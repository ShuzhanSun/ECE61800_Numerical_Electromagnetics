# ECE61800_Projects_SS
Course projects for Purdue [ECE 61800 Numerical Electromagnetics][ECE618], Spring 2018. All necessary theories and formulas can be found in the textbook: *Theory and Computation of Electromagnetic Fields* ([Jin. 2015][Jin2015]).

## Project 1: Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method
**Team Members**: Chang Yang (ECE), Skanda Kotethota (ECE), Shuzhan Sun

**Brief Summary**: We implemented Yee's 3D FDTD algorithm on parallel plate waveguide. We designed a GUI to generate both numerical and analytical field distributions in the wave guide. Thanks to the hard work of the entire team, our group was awarded to have lunch with the instructor because of the best overall performance. 

## Project 2: Finite Element Method (FEM)
**Team Mmembers**: Ahmed Abdelraheem (ECE), Pintu Adhikari (ECE), Shuzhan Sun

**Brief Summary**: We used FEM to simulate rectangular waveguide. We designed a GUI to plot the modal field distribution and propagation constant. We observed excellent match between the numerical solutions and analytical solutions. Thanks to the hard work of the entire team, our group was selected to present our work in the class.

## Project 3: Method of Moments (MOM)
**Team Members**: Shuzhan Sun

**Brief Summary**: I used 3-D MOM to simulate the thin wire antenna. I designed a GUI to plot the current distribution as well as input admittance of center-fed antenna and end-fed antenna.
